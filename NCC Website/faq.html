<header> What is a drone? <span>[+]</span> </header>
<div>
A drone is an unmanned aerial vehicle that is remotely controlled through software-controlled flight plans embedded in its systems. It works in conjunction with an onboard sensor and GPS. Alison's free online drone training courses will teach you the components of this unmanned aircraft. You will also learn how it can fly autonomously.

<header> Do i need a permit to fly a drone? <span>[+]</span> </header>
<div>
In many countries a permit is required for commercial use of unmanned microcopters (drone). This is issued either individually or generally by the respective states and is valid for several years. We have compiled all the necessary information and local contacts for our customers to easily obtain the permit, and will be provided to you after purchasing a Height-Tech multicopter.

<article>
<header> Apart from aerial photo, what are other uses of drones? <span>[+]</span> </header>
<div>
Of course the applications go far beyond aerial photography. For example, we have already created 3D maps and charts using our drones, which allows for e.g. the volume of a lignite opencast mine to be calculated. There are also options for using thermal imaging- or near-infrared cameras. This allows for faults in solar panels or the water shortage of plants to be detected from the air. If you own a special sensor technology system we will adapt it to our drones (or our drone to your system) and put it in the air.

<article>
<header> How high can a drone fly? <span>[+]</span> </header>
<div>
The range of the drone control is about 1.5 km. Export systems can achieve a range of up to 50 km. The range is limited due to the mandatory (in Germany) visual contact between the pilot and the aircraft. In the field our larger drones can therefore operate at a perimeter and altitude of about 200m. When using the drone in the mountains the limits are set by the low atmospheric pressure and low temperatures. However, our drones have already been successfully used at 3,950 m above sea level and in temperatures of -15 °C.

<article>
<header> Can drones be used indoors? <span>[+]</span> </header>
<div>
The emission-free and silent electric drives of course also allow our drones to be used indoors. Applications are e.g. demo flights at trade fairs or film shots inside buildings. Due to the typically limited space a suitable launch and landing site not accessible by onlookers must be provided. Since the GPS and compass sensor technology is typically extremely limited inside buildings, the pilot must be able to control the drone manually.
</div>

<article>
<header> What are the restrictions in flying a drone? <span>[+]</span> </header>
<div>
In an operator of a drone partakes in air traffic and must also comply with the regulations of the Air Traffic Act and Air Traffic Order.  has few restrictions for using drones with a take-off weight of up to 25 kg.

For example, a minimum distance of 1.5 km from airports must be maintained, and there are a few no-fly zones. We will instruct you on all the pertinent areas of the air regulations and you will then be able to legally and safely pursue your business.

<article>
<header> Are drones easy to fly? <span>[+]</span> </header>
<div>
We feel it is very important even for customers without model flight experience to be able to control our drones. Our drones feature a number of stabilising sensors so the pilot can focus on the actual task, e.g. aerial photography.

It?s helpful to be able to fly a drone manually without stabilisation aids in order to exhaust its maximum capabilities. We therefore offer extensive flight training to each customer, virtually as well as with a robust practice drone.

To date each of our customers learned how to handle their drone from us. So can you.

<article>
<header> Can a drones be insured? <span>[+]</span> </header>
<div>
Commercial use of drones requires a special aircraft liability insurance. This will insure you against damage to other valuables or persons. The insurance premium varies from 170 and 1,600 EUR annually depending on the insurance company, with the amount insured ranging from 1.5 ? 3 MM EUR.

<article>
<header> What Kind of Signal Do Drones Use? <span>[+]</span> </header>
<div>

Drones communicate using radio waves on specific radio frequencies, which are called bands. Radio waves are invisible waveforms on the electromagnetic spectrum and are measured in hertz (Hz).

Frequencies used by devices range from 20-kilohertz (kHz) to 300-gigahertz (GHz). Most radio communications involve the use of a transmitter and a receiver. 

The transmitter sends data using radio waves on a specific frequency. The receiver is tuned to the same frequency to accept the transmission. When operating a drone, the remote control and the drone may act as both transmitters and receivers.
